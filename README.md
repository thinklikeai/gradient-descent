## **Project 1: Gradient Descent for 2D Functions**

### **Overview**

The first project focuses on applying **Gradient Descent to 2D functions**. The aim is to find the minimum value of a given 2D function using the gradient descent algorithm. The project demonstrates the mechanics of gradient descent in a simplified 2D space.

### **Key Features**

- **Initial Visualization**: Scatter plots and line graphs to understand the function's shape.
- **Gradient Calculation**: Custom-built function for calculating the gradient in a 2D space.
- **Optimization**: Iterative algorithm to move towards the minimum of the function.

## **Project 2: Gradient Descent for 3D Functions**

### **Overview**

The second project extends the gradient descent algorithm to **3D functions**. The complexity increases as we move from a 2D to a 3D space, but the core principles remain the same. The project explores how to adapt the gradient descent algorithm for higher-dimensional functions.

### **Key Features**

- **3D Visualization**: Utilizes 3D plots to visualize the shape of the function.
- **Multi-variable Gradient**: Computes gradients for functions with multiple variables.
- **Advanced Optimization**: Adapted algorithm to traverse the 3D space and find the minimum.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: The backbone of both projects, offering a flexible environment for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for all visualizations, including 2D and 3D plots.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations and handling multi-dimensional arrays.
